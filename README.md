# API clients

Because we define our API-endpoints following the openAPI specifications, we can auto-generate clients to interact with the API.

## Python

The python client works out of the box and can easily be installed, from the python directory (`./api-clients/python/`)

    cd python
    python setup.py install

## R

To install the R-clients, from this directory (`./api-clients/`)

    R CMD install R

For R, there's a few bugs in the autogenerated clients, so we need to make a few adjustments after the autogeneration of the code.  The code in this repository **already has these changes** and is only useful when generating the client from the API-definitions.

1. Add all classes to NAMESPACE (this is a bug in openapitools)

    chmod 664 R/NAMESPACE

    python -c '''
    import os
    files = os.listdir("R/R/")
    objects = [x.split(".")[0] for x in files]
    objects = ["export(%s)"%obj for obj in objects]
    namespacestring = "\n".join(objects)
    with open("R/NAMESPACE", "r+") as fl:
      fl.write(namespacestring)
    '''
